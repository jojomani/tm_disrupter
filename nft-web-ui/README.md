This project contains the files for [Alchemy's NFT Minter tutorial](https://docs.alchemyapi.io/alchemy/tutorials/nft-minter). We have connected our Smart Contract to our React dApp project by building an NFT Minter using Metamask and Web3.

This React dApp is hosted on Heroku, [check it out](https://tmd-nft.herokuapp.com/)!
